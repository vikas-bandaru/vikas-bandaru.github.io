With all the conversations post my first blog still going on, here goes the second\u00a0one\u2026</p>\n<p>This one is entirely dedicated to my students who have talked their heart out to me in the past few days and made me realize yet again that times have not changed, instead, they have become even more difficult. It deeply troubles me to know that my students too, face the same confusion and helplessness I once did, years back. And this pandemic has only worsened it with all the uncertainty in the job market and inflation it has brought along with it. So, in crazy times like this, it\u2019s very important not to go nuts, not to stop or give up, not to break down, but to keep calm, take deep breaths (sometimes literally), clear the clutter in your head, start fresh or take it from where u left, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help, thrive and conquer it in bits and pieces, no matter what. But, just don\u2019t stop there, reach out and help your friends, who you know are struggling to find a direction. Everyone has that friend who is clueless about their career. Especially in times like this, the world is in so much need of humanity as much as social distancing. So, remember to check on your friends occasionally, or even better would be, getting a team to learn or work together.</p>\n<p>As my part, I wanted to share with you the turmoil I went through, the challenges I faced, and the storms I harnessed within me and my successes too, in the sincere hope that it would help you with your\u00a0own.</p>\n<p>As I already mentioned in my last <a href=\"https://link.medium.com/vKN7b5toIfb\">post</a>, I was neither a brilliant student nor a hardworking one. Mediocrity or doing things just to keep my head above the water level was my nature unless I found something very intriguing. I\u2019ve had my good share of failures and backlogs. From being unable to do programs on my own in labs to failing in my semester exams, I\u2019ve been there and seen it all. I know exactly how it feels. It was so discouraging and embarrassing that I couldn\u2019t even share it with my family and friends. Slowly, I started closing myself. I stopped trying the things I failed at. I got diverted from learning and trying things to computer games. Day and night, I would play Road Rash, Mario, Age of Empires, NFS, Wolfenstein, SnakeXO, and many other primitive games which you wouldn\u2019t even have heard of. Same time, luckily for me(which I realize now), my computer stopped working too. It was a time of PCs (Personal Computers), which had huge monitors and CPUs. It was the time when the internet was available through a dial-up connection, maybe in KBs of speed. There were not many computer service centres either. \u201cYou\u2019re a CSE student, can\u2019t you do it yourself\u2026?\u201d, my dad asked. \u201cWhat is there to lose?\u201d, I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s anyway not working\u201d.</p>\n<p>I decided to try out what I learnt in a subject called IT workshop, where we were shown and taught how to open the CPU cabinet and check for hardware problems. It was one of the practical subjects with very little theory. For example, if the RAM was not placed in its slot correctly, it would make a continuous loud beep sound. So, when you get a continuous beep, you know what to do, and when you put the RAM into its slot, instantly, the beep would go off. It made sense! It was so easy to understand. \u201cNow is my chance to get my hands dirty!\u201d, I thought and for the first time, I removed all the connections and opened my CPU cabinet. I was free to do anything without the fear of damaging my CPU, as long as I\u2019m a bit careful with the matching pins. After a struggle of two hours, my computer was back in form. I cannot explain in words the bubbling joy I had with that small accomplishment. It was my first \u201cAha\u201d moment! I realized three things that day. One- I can repair my computer. Two- I do things better when there is nothing to lose. Three- Practical experiments give the satisfaction that books or manuals cannot. It also occurred to me that doing a program on the computer was much more fun than writing it on paper. I give credit to that day for not letting out the fire in me. There were still a few sparks left in\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>A few months later, I tried to install Linux on my computer by getting a copy of Ubuntu from a friend. The first time was a disaster. I successfully installed it only to realize that all my data was lost because of a partitioning issue. All the existing data on the hard disk was erased and overridden by Ubuntu, I did not know why and how it happened. All my precious collection of movies, photos, games, songs, books which I had collected over the years, which I was very proud of, were all gone in a snap. What a huge loss it was! It took me a while to recover from it. What was the lesson learnt? Always have a backup! After many attempts, I finally could get a dual boot system with Windows and Ubuntu sharing my hardware. But then, I came across something more interesting, VirtualBox! I learnt that if I installed VirtualBox, I could install many OSs (operating systems) on my computer just like any other software. So, it was better than a dual boot and I would never lose my data too. Who would know better, what losing was! Though it took me a few days to learn and install the VirtualBox, it was all worth the pain. That was one of the coolest things, having two operating systems within the same computer. Later, I experimented a lot with virtualization. There was a time when I had 5 guest operating systems on my host Windows. I had a small network of computers inside my little PC. I never again lost a thing on my computer. Those were my baby steps towards Virtualization, aka Cloud Computing.</p>\n<p>Months passed exploring and trying out new things once in a while, and then, there came the age of the internet and mobile phones. Suddenly, everyone who had \u201cinternet\u201d at home was considered to be fortunate and everyone who had a mobile felt like it\u2019s the best thing that happened to them. Everyone\u2019s world was changed. They would talk, play games, and text on the phone all day long. It started then, and it\u2019s still going on. Then the internet came into mobile phones and changed our lives forever. Like everyone else, I too got addicted to texting and gaming. Games were crazily addictive. It was gaming on the computer at home, and when outside, it was gaming on the phone. I spent months of tiresome days and sleepless nights playing games. I completely fell off track. The games were so alluring and engaging that I didn\u2019t realize how many years slipped away. I completed my graduation going through this phase. Now that I look back, I feel that it was the most precious time of my life which got completely wasted. It took me a hell of a lot of time to get my life back on track, and this is how it happened.</p>\n<p>After I completed my graduation, life began to show its true face. A ruthless one. There was tremendous pressure from within. When I saw my friends get their first job, I was happy for them, but there was a stabbing pain in my heart too. I struggled so hard with the uncertain and insecure future. I had no plan. I was completely clueless. But still, I was hopelessly playing games. On one such day, a close friend of mine came over to my place. He was a rather sorted-out person than I was. I showed him all the games I was blown away with. We did a lot of gaming that day and somewhere in one of the conversations, he casually asked me, \u201cI see that you\u2019re so good at gaming\u2026 But, what\u2019s so special in playing games, try making them..\u201d. It hit me real hard. Though I was a computer science student, it never occurred to me till then, those games were software too. They were made by Computer Science Engineers too. So, once again, after a long gap, I decided to go back on track and give it a try at making\u00a0games.</p>\n<p>They were not easy to make, it took me a lot of hard work and almost a month to make my first game. But in the process, I had another \u201cAha\u201d moment! I realized that making a game gave me the same adrenaline rush that winning in games did. So, that\u2019s how I found my spark for programming. I saw programming as a tool to make games and create something new, something that never existed before, which was mine. And then, I didn\u2019t look back. I dug deep into whatever kindled my interest. Coding Games, Softwares, projects and then finally teaching in a school for a few months helped me discover my passion. Teaching programming it was! Whenever a student came up to tell me that his mind was blown by what he learnt in class and that I made him think, his words would ring in my ears all day. The feeling was priceless.</p>\n<p>Though I had my share of ups and downs, good and bad times, life has been kind enough to lead me into the path where I found my happiness.</p>\n<p>A few life lessons I learnt along the\u00a0way\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s okay to fail.</strong> It\u2019s okay to make mistakes. Failure is not the opposite of success, it\u2019s a part of success. The worst part would be if you\u2019re not trying. As long as you\u2019re trying and making mistakes, it\u2019s fine. My dad always says, \u201cnot trying is like turning back from a battle, even before entering into\u00a0one\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching.</strong> People and places, challenges and confrontations, journeys and adventures, books and novels, job and college, love and heartbreaks, everything has something to teach. And when you have those \u201cAha\u201d moments, life changes in a\u00a0snap!</p>\n<p><strong>Mastery is an acquaintance to the deserving. </strong>It is not reserved for the genius or\u00a0talented</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cIt is a function of time and intense focus applied to any field of knowledge\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u2014 Robert\u00a0Greene</blockquote>\n<p>Your experiences may not be the same as mine, nor will your life be. You\u2019ll have your battles to fight and your monsters to defeat. I hope with all my heart that you reach the skies! And who knows, if you try enough, you might grow up to be so big and successful someday that I might read your story in your biography! Would love to see that happen! Nothing in the world would make me more\u00a0proud!</p>\n<p>So now, to all the teachers out there, do you have a similar story as mine!

I\u2019ve heard many people say it to me or my friends many a time. They just conclude that we either didn\u2019t try hard enough or that we\u2019re not smart enough. But no one asks us or thinks, \u201cWhy are they not ready for a job..?\u201d \u201cAre they really not ready\u2026? or is it just their insecurities acting up\u2026?\u201d \u201cWhat happened in their lives so significantly that an outstanding number of students don\u2019t feel confident to take up a job or even attend an interview or don\u2019t perform well enough in an interview even after they complete their graduation? No one cares to ask or think about what went wrong. So, I thought I\u2019d do it for myself - try to figure out where and what went\u00a0wrong.</p>\n<p>So, this is how it all started. Just like any other upper-middle-class parents would do, my parents got me admitted to a school with a pretty good reputation. My teachers were doing a good job. They came, taught us Math, English, Science, Social Studies, and left. Everything was going fine. But no one told us why we need to study these subjects, each one of them. What would we lose or gain by studying these \u201csubjects\u201d and how would it help us grow? I managed to score good enough in all the subjects, at least good enough not to get noticed by my teachers as a poor student or get scolded before my crush. I just had to learn what I was taught and write \u201ccorrect answers\u201d in the exam and get good marks. It was a happy, carefree life. I did exactly what I was told and scored \u201cgood\u201d marks in my Board exams. As I got the highest score in Math, my parents asked me to take up MPC (Math-Physics-Chemistry) in +2, which would allow me to join in \u201cEngineering\u201d for Graduation. But the problem here was that I did not like either of them. Neither Math nor Physics nor Chemistry. I was interested in Art. Drawing portraits, sketching, and painting beautiful sceneries, that\u2019s what I loved. I would lose track of time and spend hours in my room, doing my most favorite thing in the world\u200a\u2014\u200amaking art! But my parents didn\u2019t see it as something out of which I could make a living, but just as a good hobby, done when you have plenty of time to spare. So, just like most other parents, they ruled out my idea of taking up Art as a career and I, as an obedient son, took up MPC, without knowing what great miseries life had in store for\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>I managed to get a seat in an Engineering college as planned. And again, as suggested by my parents, I got into Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), as it would fetch me a job in the \u201cIT industry\u201d. It was the latest trend back then, 10th(SSC)\u200a\u2014\u200aInter(MPC)\u200a\u2014\u200aB Tech(CSE)\u200a\u2014\u200aJob(Software). Everyone around me found it, the perfect place to land\u200a\u2014\u200aan IT\u00a0job.</p>\n<p>The world around me had suddenly changed. It was no longer the carefree life I was used to. English and Math appeared now and then, but chemistry, Social Studies, and Physics had disappeared completely. New subjects like Programming Languages, Digital Logic and Design (DLD), Electronic Devices and Circuits (EDC), Basic Electrical Engineering (BEE) appeared. Life had become complicated. I was no longer told what to do, nor was taught or was dictated answers like in school, there was nobody who cared how and what I wrote in exams. There were just so many expectations, implications, and consequences.</p>\n<p>I was suddenly expected to become mature, know my responsibilities, get studious, complete lots of assignments and records. I was expected to know how to write my exams and get good grades, do projects which involved lots of coding and designing (in which I never had any practical knowledge) which would consequently get me a good job. But I simply did not see any connection between them. I did not understand how doing assignments and programs in labs would teach me to do projects and ultimately help me get a job. I was a lost soul, searching for answers to my questions and did not know whom to ask. It was not only me who was lost, but most of my classmates.</p>\n<p>At that age, what do you do when nobody around you knows what to do! Just settle with what you know. That\u2019s what I did. I convinced myself or I should say, rather forced myself to think that\u2019s how life is going to be, Boring, and I must just get on with it. Time flew and I did learn how to get along with it, still not having answers to any of my questions. I learnt that I had to do a mini project followed by a major project in my final year. And then I came to know, how to get my hands on a project. It did not matter what the project was. I just had to have a project in hand. So, along with all my classmates, I got one\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>Throughout my college life, there was one incident that kinda sparked my interest. One of my teachers showed the demonstration of a project and for the first time, it suddenly struck me that any software is man-made! I was quite mesmerized. But then, there were classes and labs to attend, assignments and records to complete. They kept us quite busy. But then again, however busy, and uninterested I was in all the classes, that one experience I had with my teacher, lingered in my brain. Somewhere, at the back of my head, I wanted to taste the experience of making software someday. I barely survived the four years of my college. After many attempts and re-attempts, I managed to clear all the subjects with minimum marks. According to my parents and all the world around me, I had officially completed my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering. But for me, it was just a big mess in my head. Four years had gone by and nothing much got into my head. There was very little I could recall from the classes. I had no job and saw no chance of getting one anywhere nearby. Those were days of insane stress. I spent most days locked up in my room trying to figure out a way to get my life\u00a0started.</p>\n<p>On one such day, I lay on my bed recalling all the highlights of my life\u200a\u2014\u200afriends, cousins, crushes, teachers, all the stupid things I did, all the good and bad choices I made, everyone and everything that played a role in my life. And suddenly, the most exciting experience of my college life came to mind- the project that my teacher showed and how intrigued I was by it. I felt an urge to try it out. I browsed the internet with the little knowledge I had (I forgot to mention that I was a geek, by nature), gathered some resources and started writing bits and pieces of code, and did experiments with what I learnt. The more I dug into it, the more I was drawn into it. It seemed so fascinating, this new world I found. I learnt some very fascinating things about coding. It became my new hobby, more than just a hobby. With all the crazy experimentation I did, I found that there was logic behind everything that you see. Not only inside the computer but even outside of it. Trace patterns and sequences and try to find logic in everything around you. And once you start to see things from that angle, you won\u2019t be able to unsee them. The more logically you start to see things around you, the more life starts to unfold differently. In a much easier way. In a logical way. Since then, my life changed, and this time, in a better way.

I\u2019ve heard many people say it to me or my friends many a time. They just conclude that we either didn\u2019t try hard enough or that we\u2019re not smart enough. But no one asks us or thinks, \u201cWhy are they not ready for a job..?\u201d \u201cAre they really not ready\u2026? or is it just their insecurities acting up\u2026?\u201d \u201cWhat happened in their lives so significantly that an outstanding number of students don\u2019t feel confident to take up a job or even attend an interview or don\u2019t perform well enough in an interview even after they complete their graduation? No one cares to ask or think about what went wrong. So, I thought I\u2019d do it for myself - try to figure out where and what went\u00a0wrong.</p>\n<p>So, this is how it all started. Just like any other upper-middle-class parents would do, my parents got me admitted to a school with a pretty good reputation. My teachers were doing a good job. They came, taught us Math, English, Science, Social Studies, and left. Everything was going fine. But no one told us why we need to study these subjects, each one of them. What would we lose or gain by studying these \u201csubjects\u201d and how would it help us grow? I managed to score good enough in all the subjects, at least good enough not to get noticed by my teachers as a poor student or get scolded before my crush. I just had to learn what I was taught and write \u201ccorrect answers\u201d in the exam and get good marks. It was a happy, carefree life. I did exactly what I was told and scored \u201cgood\u201d marks in my Board exams. As I got the highest score in Math, my parents asked me to take up MPC (Math-Physics-Chemistry) in +2, which would allow me to join in \u201cEngineering\u201d for Graduation. But the problem here was that I did not like either of them. Neither Math nor Physics nor Chemistry. I was interested in Art. Drawing portraits, sketching, and painting beautiful sceneries, that\u2019s what I loved. I would lose track of time and spend hours in my room, doing my most favorite thing in the world\u200a\u2014\u200amaking art! But my parents didn\u2019t see it as something out of which I could make a living, but just as a good hobby, done when you have plenty of time to spare. So, just like most other parents, they ruled out my idea of taking up Art as a career and I, as an obedient son, took up MPC, without knowing what great miseries life had in store for\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>I managed to get a seat in an Engineering college as planned. And again, as suggested by my parents, I got into Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), as it would fetch me a job in the \u201cIT industry\u201d. It was the latest trend back then, 10th(SSC)\u200a\u2014\u200aInter(MPC)\u200a\u2014\u200aB Tech(CSE)\u200a\u2014\u200aJob(Software). Everyone around me found it, the perfect place to land\u200a\u2014\u200aan IT\u00a0job.</p>\n<p>The world around me had suddenly changed. It was no longer the carefree life I was used to. English and Math appeared now and then, but chemistry, Social Studies, and Physics had disappeared completely. New subjects like Programming Languages, Digital Logic and Design (DLD), Electronic Devices and Circuits (EDC), Basic Electrical Engineering (BEE) appeared. Life had become complicated. I was no longer told what to do, nor was taught or was dictated answers like in school, there was nobody who cared how and what I wrote in exams. There were just so many expectations, implications, and consequences.</p>\n<p>I was suddenly expected to become mature, know my responsibilities, get studious, complete lots of assignments and records. I was expected to know how to write my exams and get good grades, do projects which involved lots of coding and designing (in which I never had any practical knowledge) which would consequently get me a good job.
